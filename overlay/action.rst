==========
action API
==========

The action API was introduced as part of the manifest v3 specification and first appeared in Thunderbird 105.
It is identical to the old ``browserAction`` and very similar to Firefox's `action API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/action>`__.
