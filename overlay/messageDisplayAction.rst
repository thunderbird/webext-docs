====================
messageDisplayAction
====================

The messageDisplayAction API was added in Thunderbird 71, and was uplifted to Thunderbird 68.3
ESR. It is similar to Firefox's `browserAction API`__ and can be combined with the
:doc:`messageDisplay` API to determine the currently displayed message.
