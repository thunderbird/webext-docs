.. _messageDisplay_api:

==================
messageDisplay API
==================

The message display API first appeared in Thunderbird 68.

A message can be displayed in either a 3-pane tab, a tab of its own, or in a window of its own.
All are referenced by ``tabId`` in this API. Display windows are considered to have exactly one
tab, which has limited functionality compared to tabs from the main window.
