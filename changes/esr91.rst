================================
Changes up to Thunderbird 91 ESR
================================

-------------------
Thunderbird 81 Beta
-------------------

messageDisplay
==============

* The :ref:`messageDisplay.getDisplayedMessages` function has been added to allow access to details of multiple-selection of email. Previously only a single selection function was available.

* The :ref:`messageDisplay.onMessagesDisplayed` event has been added.

See the documentation on those functions and events for more information.

-------------------
Thunderbird 82 Beta
-------------------

compose
=======

* Attachments can now be specified in the :ref:`beginNew <compose.beginNew>`,
  :ref:`beginReply <compose.beginReply>`, and :ref:`beginForward <compose.beginForward>` functions.

tabs
====

* The :ref:`connect <tabs.connect>` and :ref:`sendMessage <tabs.sendMessage>` functions now work as
  they do in Firefox.

messageDisplayScripts/tabs
==========================

* Content script functions can now operate on a message display "tab" in the same way they do on a
  content tab in Thunderbird or Firefox. This requires the new "messagesModify" permission.

  Here are some basic examples. See `the MDN documentation`__ for a more in-depth explanation.

  .. code-block:: javascript

    // Where tabId is the id of a message display tab:

    browser.tabs.executeScript(tabId, {
      code: `document.body.textContent = "Hey look, the script ran!";`,
    });

    browser.tabs.executeScript(tabId, {
      file: "display.js",
    });

    browser.tabs.insertCSS(tabId, {
      code: "body { background-color: red; }",
    });

    browser.tabs.insertCSS(tabId, {
      file: "display.css",
    });

    browser.tabs.removeCSS(tabId, {
      code: "body { background-color: red; }",
    });

    browser.tabs.removeCSS(tabId, {
      file: "display.css",
    });

__ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts

* Scripts can also be registered to run automatically on messages being displayed, using the new
  :doc:`/messageDisplayScripts` API.
  
  Again, this works just like the contentScripts API:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    let registeredScripts = await browser.messageDisplayScripts.register({
      css: [
        // Any number of code or file objects could be listed here.
        { code: "body { background-color: red; }" },
        { file: "display.css" },
      ],
      js: [
        // Any number of code or file objects could be listed here.
        { code: `document.body.textContent = "Hey look, the script ran!";` },
        { file: "display.js" },
      ],
    });

  Added code will run immediately and CSS will be immediately applied to already-open message
  display tabs or windows, and any new message display tabs or windows.

  The returned value, ``registeredScripts`` in this example, is an object with which you can
  unregister the code/CSS:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    await registeredScripts.unregister();

.. note::

  This functionality does *not* permanently alter messages, only what the user sees when they are
  displayed.

-------------------
Thunderbird 83 Beta
-------------------

compose
=======

* :ref:`ComposeAttachment <compose.ComposeAttachment>` objects now have a ``size`` property with
  the size of the attachment in bytes.

contacts
========

* The :ref:`onUpdated <contacts.onUpdated>` event now calls listeners with a second argument,
  containing details of the changes made. For example:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "FirstName": {
        "oldValue": "Daniel",
        "newValue": "Danielle"
      },
      "DisplayName": {
        "oldValue": "Daniel Smith",
        "newValue": "Danielle Smith"
      }
    }

menus
=====

* A ``compose_attachment`` context can now be used. This context applies when the user opens a
  context menu on selected attachments in a compose window. The selected attachments can be
  accessed from the ``attachments`` property in an :ref:`onShown <menus.onShown>` or
  :ref:`onClicked <menus.onClicked>` listener.
  
* The standard properties available to :ref:`onShown <menus.onShown>` are now available for
  messages being displayed, if your extension has the ``messagesRead`` permission.

-------------------
Thunderbird 84 Beta
-------------------

compose
=======

* The :ref:`beginNew <compose.beginNew>` function now has an optional ``messageId`` argument. If
  ``messageId`` is provided, the referenced message is opened to compose as a new message. This
  works for ordinary messages and templates.
  
* Using :ref:`beginForward <compose.beginForward>` function with a ``forwardInline`` type and
  ``details`` argument specified has been fixed.
    

menus
=====

* The standard properties available to :ref:`onShown <menus.onShown>` are now available for
  messages being composed, if your extension has the ``compose`` permission.

tabs
====

* At start-up, :ref:`tabs.create <tabs.create>` will now wait for a window to open before
  attempting to open a tab.
 
windows
=======

* The :ref:`windows.openDefaultBrowser` function has been added. 

browserAction
==================================================

* The :ref:`browserAction.setLabel` and :ref:`browserAction.getLabel` functions have been added. It is now possible to set a label value different from the title (which is used as tooltip text). The label can be set to an empty string to make the action button not have a label at all. If the toolbar is set to text-mode only (no icons), the action button label uses the title as fallback, in case an empty label has been set.

composeAction
==================================================

* The :ref:`composeAction.setLabel` and :ref:`composeAction.getLabel` functions have been added. It is now possible to set a label value different from the title (which is used as tooltip text). The label can be set to an empty string to make the action button not have a label at all. If the toolbar is set to text-mode only (no icons), the action button label uses the title as fallback, in case an empty label has been set.

messageDisplayAction
==================================================

* The :ref:`messageDisplayAction.setLabel` and :ref:`messageDisplayAction.getLabel` functions have been added. It is now possible to set a label value different from the title (which is used as tooltip text). The label can be set to an empty string to make the action button not have a label at all. If the toolbar is set to text-mode only (no icons), the action button label uses the title as fallback, in case an empty label has been set.

-------------------
Thunderbird 85 Beta
-------------------

addressBooks & contacts
=======================

The :ref:`addressBooks_api` and :ref:`contacts_api` APIs will now return read-only address books. Add-ons that may update contacts and address books should check the ``readOnly`` flag of :ref:`addressBooks.AddressBookNode`.

accounts
========

* The ``composeHtml`` property has been added to the :ref:`identities.MailIdentity` type, to indicate, if the identity uses HTML as the default compose format.

* The :ref:`accounts.getDefaultIdentity` function has been added, to get the default identity of a given account. Use :ref:`accounts.getDefault` to get the default account.

compose
=======

* The begin* functions now honor ``body``, ``plainTextBody`` and ``isPlaintext`` as compose format selectors, overriding the default compose format of the used/default identity. The :ref:`accounts_api` API can be used to get the used/default identity and its default compose format.

messages
========

* :ref:`messages.query` supports queries for messages with a given ``headerMessageId``

-------------------
Thunderbird 86 Beta
-------------------

theme
=====

* The :ref:`theme_api` API was added to Thunderbird (see `bug 1684666 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1684666>`__). Itâ€™s more or less the same as the `Firefox theme API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/theme>`__, but has been extended to better fit the needs of Thunderbird.

  The color key ``sidebar_highlight_border`` has been added.
