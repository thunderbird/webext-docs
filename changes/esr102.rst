=================================
Changes up to Thunderbird 102 ESR
=================================

-------------------
Thunderbird 95 Beta
-------------------

compose API
============

* added ``relatedMessageId`` property to the :ref:`compose.ComposeDetails` type

-------------------
Thunderbird 96 Beta
-------------------

cloudFile API
=============

* added ``templateInfo`` as a supported return value property of the :ref:`cloudFile.onFileUpload` event, to specify a :ref:`cloudFile.CloudFileTemplateInfo` with additional information for the cloud file entry added to the users message
* added ``error`` as a supported return value property of the :ref:`cloudFile.onFileUpload` event, to show an error message to the user, in case upload failed

* added :ref:`cloudFile.onFileRename` event to properly handle cloud file rename operations (the file on the server should be renamed as well, if the cloud file attachment in the email is renamed by the user)

messages API
============

* added ``attachment`` as a supported property of the :ref:`messages.query` function, to be able to query for messages with or without attachments

-------------------
Thunderbird 97 Beta
-------------------

cloudFile API
=============

* deprecated the ``manifest.service_url`` entry, it is superseded by the optional ``service_url`` property of the :ref:`cloudFile.CloudFileTemplateInfo`
* added new optional properties to :ref:`cloudFile.CloudFileTemplateInfo` : ``download_expiry_date``, ``download_limit`` and ``download_password_protected``

-------------------
Thunderbird 98 Beta
-------------------

accounts API
============

* added :ref:`accounts.onCreated`, :ref:`accounts.onDeleted` and :ref:`accounts.onUpdated` events

cloudFile API
=============

* added manifest property ``reuse_uploads``, to allow providers to disable automatic link reuse of already known cloud files: If a previously uploaded cloud file attachment is reused at a later time in a different message, Thunderbird may use the already known ``url`` and ``templateInfo`` values without triggering the registered :ref:`cloudFile.onFileUpload` listener again. Setting this option to false will always trigger the registered listener, providing the already known values through the ``relatedFileInfo`` parameter of the :ref:`cloudFile.onFileUpload` event, to let the provider decide how to handle these cases.
* added the ``relatedFileInfo`` parameter of the :ref:`cloudFile.onFileUpload` event: Information about an already uploaded cloud file, which is related to a new upload. For example if the content of a cloud attachment is updated, if a repeatedly used cloud attachment is renamed (and therefore should be re-uploaded to not invalidate existing links) or if the provider has its manifest property ``reuse_uploads`` set to ``false``.

compose API
===========

* deprecated the ``getFile()`` function of the :ref:`compose.ComposeAttachment` (example of a backward-compatible drop-in `wrapper function <https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/addons/T290381ad849307a1-Mda1465bd6388138d5a893ff8/request-to-deprecate-composeattachment-getfile>`__)
* added :ref:`compose.getAttachmentFile` function to get the content of a :ref:`compose.ComposeAttachment` as a DOM ``File`` object
* added support to use a :ref:`compose.ComposeAttachment` as the attachment in :ref:`compose.addAttachment` and in :ref:`compose.ComposeDetails`
* modified the rules for ``body``, ``plainTextBody`` and ``isPlainText`` properties of :ref:`compose.ComposeDetails` in a backward compatible way - specifying both body types no longer causes an exception and it is now even suggested to always specify both and either let the API pick the users default compose mode, or use the ``isPlainText`` property as selector 

--------------------
Thunderbird 100 Beta
--------------------

compose API
===========

* added support for ``customHeaders`` in :ref:`compose.ComposeDetails`

--------------------
Thunderbird 101 Beta
--------------------

cloudfile API
=============
* Support for manifest key ``data_format`` has been removed, the only supported format now is ``File``.

---------------------
Thunderbird 102.0 ESR
---------------------

compose API
===========
* Added support for ``additionalFccFolder``, ``attachVCard``, ``deliveryFormat``, ``deliveryStatusNotification``, ``overrideDefaultFcc``, ``overrideDefaultFccFolder``, ``priority`` and ``returnReceipt`` in :ref:`compose.ComposeDetails`.
* Added :ref:`compose.getActiveDictionaries`, :ref:`compose.setActiveDictionaries` and :ref:`compose.onActiveDictionariesChanged`
* Added :ref:`compose.saveMessage` and changed the return value of :ref:`compose.sendMessage` from a boolean to a complex object with information about the sent message and its local copies - both functions return a Promise which resolves once the message operation has finished

folders API
============
* Subfolders are now being returned in the order used in Thunderbird's folder pane.

messages API
============
* Added support for ``headersOnly`` to :ref:`messages.MessageHeader`.
