Working with vCard contacts
===========================

Before the release of Thunderbird 102, contacts in Thunderbird's address books only supported a `fixed set of properties <https://searchfox.org/comm-central/rev/97fafb8294c5f9c9c65d33888a03f89a10b0b19e/mailnews/addrbook/modules/VCardUtils.jsm#310-349>`__. All these properties where accessible through :ref:`contacts.ContactProperties`, extensions could store additional custom properties.

Since Thunderbird 102, contact details are stored as vCards and the former fixed properties are now referred to as legacy properties. Those legacy properties are mapped for read/write access to the best matching vCard property and are still accessible through :ref:`contacts.ContactProperties`. 

The vCard is exposed in the ``vCard`` property and changing it will update the contact according to the newly set vCard string.

.. important::

  Accessing contact details through legacy properties is **deprecated**. Newly added fields in the address book UI (e.g. the ``Timezone`` information), are not accessible through legacy properties, but only through the vCard.
  
  When updating a contact and providing values for the ``vCard`` property as well as for legacy properties, the specified legacy properties are ignored.


Updating legacy properties
===========================

A vCard can store multiple values for each type and legacy properties point to the first entry of the associated type. Deleting the one which is currently exposed through a legacy property only deletes that single entry, not all entries. Consider a contact being updated and some of its legacy properties are cleared as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

  await messenger.contacts.update(id, {
    "PrimaryEmail" : null,
    "HomePhone" : null
  })

If the vCard had multiple email addresses or multiple home numbers, each next entry will now be exposed through the associated legacy property. This can lead to unexpected results, when setting ``SecondEmail`` on a contact which does not yet have any email entries:

.. code-block:: javascript

  await messenger.contacts.update(id, {
    "SecondEmail" : "user@inter.net",
  })
  
  let { properties } = await messenger.contacts.get(id);
  console.log(properties);

The console output will include ``PrimaryEmail: user@inter.net``, but no value for ``SecondEmail``, simply because ``PrimaryEmail`` points to the first email address stored in the vCard.


Updating the vCard property
===========================

Instead of parsing or manipulating the vCard string manually, we recommend to use the same `library that Thunderbird itself is using <https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js/releases>`__ for parsing. Add the ``ical.js`` file from the linked repository to your add-on and load it into your background. One way is to add it to the manifest as follows:

.. code-block:: json

  "background": {
    "scripts": [
      "ical.js",
      "background.js"
    ]
  },

In the ``background.js`` script one can now parse vCard strings as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Get JSON representation of the vCard data.
  let vCardObj = ICAL.parse("BEGIN:VCARD\r\nVERSION:4.0\r\nN:LastName;FirstName;;;\r\nEMAIL;PREF=1:user@inter.net\r\nEND:VCARD\r\n");
  let [ component, jCard ] = vCardObj;
  
  /* ICAL.parse() return value:
   *  
   * Array(3)
   *  0: "vcard"     // Name of the component.
   *  1: Array(4)    // Array of entries.
   *     0: Array(4) ["version", {}, "text", "4.0" ]
   *     1: Array(4) [ "n", {}, "text", [ "", "first", "", "", "" ] ]
   *     2: Array(4) [ "email", { pref: "1" }, "text", "user@inter.net"]
   *  2: Array []    // Array of subcomponents, should be empty for vCard, used
   *                 // by vCalendar, which has vEvent subcomponents.
   */

  // Manipulate the jCard object.
  if (component == "vcard") {
    let email = jCard.find(e => e[0] == "email");
    if (email) {
      email[3] = "other@inter.net"
    }
  }

  // Update the contact.
  messenger.contacts.update(id, {vCard: ICAL.stringify(vCardObj)});

The ical library also supports manipulating the data on a higher level, using the ``Component`` class:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Get JSON representation of the vCard data (jCal).
  var vCard = new ICAL.Component(ICAL.parse("BEGIN:VCARD\r\nVERSION:4.0\r\nN:LastName;FirstName;;;\r\nEMAIL;PREF=1:user@inter.net\r\nEND:VCARD\r\n"));
  
  // Add an entry.
  vCard.addPropertyWithValue("email", "third@inter.net");
  
  /* Other useful methods:
   *
   *  vCard.getFirstProperty("email")
   *  vCard.getFirstPropertyValue("email")
   *
   *  vCard.getAllProperties("email")
   *  vCard.removeAllProperties("email")
   *
   *  let emailEntry = new ICAL.Property(["email", { pref: "1" }, "text", "other@inter.net"]);
   *  vCard.addProperty(emailEntry)
   *  vCard.addPropertyWithValue("email", "other2@inter.net")
   *
   *  vCard.removeProperty(emailEntry)
   */

  // Update an entry.
  let email = vCard.getAllProperties("email").find(e => e.jCal[3] == "user@inter.net");
  if (email) {
    // Option 1: Manipulate the existing jCal entry (Array(4), [name, options, type, value])
    email.jCal[3] = "other@inter.net";
    // Option 2: Remove the existing entry and add a new one (changes order of entries)
    vCard.removeProperty(email);
    vCard.addProperty(new ICAL.Property(["email", {}, "text", "other@inter.net"]);
  }

  // Update the contact.
  messenger.contacts.update(id, {vCard: vCard.toString()});
