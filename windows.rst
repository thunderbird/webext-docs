windows

.. note::

  These APIs are for the main Thunderbird windows which can contain webpage tabs and also other
  window types like composer or address books that cannot contain webpage tabs.  Make sure your
  code interacts with windows appropriately, depending on their type.

Use the ``browser.windows`` API to interact with Thunderbird. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange windows.
